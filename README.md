# grind-75-solutions

# Summary

This Repo is going to hold my solutions to my **Grind 169 questions**. I am commiting to completing all 169 Questions in a span of 16 weeks by commiting 10 hours per week to _Data Structure Algorithm Challenges_

# Repo Structure

- The assets folder is a record of the weekly screenshots showing my progress.
- `log.md` file is a log of the progress I am making. It is not a daily log, rather I will update `log.md` after I complete a challenge with my thoughts on the challenge.
- Each challenge will be coded in its own file. Every solution will include detailed comments of what is going in the code. The comments will hopefully help anyone working on the challenges.

# Helpful Resources

This section will be a list of helpful resources I use to solve the chellenges.

- [Study plan](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/). Use this resource if you want a structured approach to solving DSA challenges. I will be using it in my process. It is structured to be 3 months long so it depends how much time you have (Adapt it to your schedule accordingly)
- [Data structures and algorithms study cheatsheets](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/). Use this resource to understand the different types of data structures _e.g Arrays, Hashes, Queues, Linked Lists and others_ and most importantly the **Time complexity** associated with each data structure.
- [Leetcode challenge 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/) seems easy on first look, but the explanation by [Alisa](https://dev.to/alisabaj/recursion-and-iteration-what-are-they-and-how-to-use-them-to-merge-sorted-lists-4ofp) makes it easy to understand the implementation.
- [Leetcode challenge 22. Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/) is a tricky solution. I had to use this solution offered by [Bangar](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/discuss/1402685/Javascript-easyandclean-solution) I was stuck implementing that recursion.

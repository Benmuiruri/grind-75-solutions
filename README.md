# grind-75-solutions

# Summary
This Repo is going to hold my solutions to my **Grind 169 questions**. I am commiting to completing all 169 Questions in a span of 16 weeks by commiting 10 hours per week to *Data Structure Algorithm Challenges*

# Repo Structure
- The assets folder is a record of the weekly screenshots showing my progress.
- `log.md` file is a log of the progress I am making. It is not a daily log, rather I will update `log.md` after I complete a challenge with my thoughts on the challenge. 
- Each challenge will be coded in its own file. Every solution will include detailed comments of what is going in the code. The comments will hopefully help anyone working on the challenges. 

# Helpful Resources
This section will be a list of helpful resources I use to solve the chellenges. 
- [Data structures and algorithms study cheatsheets](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/). Use this resource to understand the different types of data structures *e.g Arrays, Hashes, Queues, Linked Lists and others* and most importantly the **Time complexity** associated with each data structure.
